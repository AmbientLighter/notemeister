# NoteMeister

Notemeister is a small interactive music-learning web app built with React, TypeScript and Vite. It displays a musical staff and an on-screen keyboard so users can practice identifying notes, hear pitches, and interact with notation in real time.

This README explains how to run, build and contribute to the project, describes the main components and outlines how to extend the app.
